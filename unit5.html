    <p>
      Thailand has 230100 sq km of arable land (“Agricultural land (sq. km) - Thailand | Data”).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thailand has approximately 11 million farmers (National Library of Medicine).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thailand has 47.81 sq km of arable land per farmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thailand produces lots of rice, cassava, corn (maize), kenaf (a jutelike fibre), longans, mangoes, pineapples, durians, and cashews. In addition to cash crops like rubber, coffee, and sugarcane. Much of this farming seems to be for commercial purposes, but a good portion of it is definitely for subsistence. Commercial meat farming is also common in northern areas, mainly beef and pork. Much of Thailand's agriculture seems to be extensive (“Thailand - Rice Exporting, Cash Crops, Forest Conservation, and Aquatic Life”).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thailand exports a ton of rice. As well as, “Thailand is the world's largest exporter of tapioca products, rubber, frozen shrimp, canned tuna, and canned pineapple” (International Trade Administration).
    </p>
    <p>
      There is conflict between commercial fishing operations and native populations who have to fight over fish in the Gulf of Thailand. In addition, shrimp ponds in Thailand cause destruction to mangrove forests. Which could become a large issue for the country (“Thailand - Rice Exporting, Cash Crops, Forest Conservation, and Aquatic Life”).
