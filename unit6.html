      There are two large and popular airports in Bangkok, Don Mueang Airport (DMK) and Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK). Both are similar international airports, at least in terms of travel convenience (“Which airport (BKK or DMK) to fly out of? - Bangkok Forum - Tripadvisor”). The major train terminals in the city do not run within the city but to places outside of the city, a majority of trains run out from Krung Thep Aphiwat Central Terminal (Thailand Trains).
